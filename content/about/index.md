# About

I'm a software engineer, architect, and technical leader with over 15 years of experience building software and leading teams in various industries. Starting as a freelance developer, I progressed through technical and leadership roles, including the CTO position.

My expertise spans the .NET ecosystem, modern JavaScript frameworks, DevOps, and cloud platforms like Azure and AWS. I have deep experience in domain-driven design, CQRS, distributed systems architecture, and agile development. I've delivered maintainable technical solutions for valuable business problems, combining technical depth with leadership experience - whether that's modernizing legacy code, building solutions from scratch, or helping teams work better together.

Currently, I work as an engineering management consultant, focusing on technical leadership, system architecture, and R&D team management. When not working with tech, I usually train for ultra-running events.

When not working with tech, I usually train for ultra-running events. My running PRs are: 148kms in 24 hours, 16 Backyard loops, 3:22 marathon, and 1:28 half.
