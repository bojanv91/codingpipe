# About

I am Bojan Veljanovski - a computer programmer, software engineer, tech leader, and ultra-runner. Currently I'm working as the CTO at [HASELT](https://haselt.com/), a custom software development, design, and consulting company, helping clients innovate and empower their businesses thru software and technology.

This is my personal blog where I share self-notes on various software development areas, but which mighty be useful for others as well.
