# About

I am Bojan Veljanovski - a computer programmer, software engineer, tech leader, and ultra runner.
This is my blog where I write notes on various software topics.

For an accumulated 15 years of experience, I have worked on the design, implementation, and delivery of medium and large-scale systems for organizations in various sectors, mainly in transportation, property & hospitality, healthcare & wellness, and access control security. I've built and maintained cloud and web software solutions for startups and SMEs. I've been a CTO for 8 years for a software development consulting company, leading the 40-person engineering and technology organization.

Soon, I'm starting as an engineering management consultant, focusing on technical leadership, system architecture, software development process, and R&D team management.

Running PRs:
