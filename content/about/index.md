# About

I am Bojan Veljanovski - a software engineer with 15+ years of experience building software and leading teams. As CTO, I led a 40-person engineering organization delivering web and cloud solutions across multiple sectors, mainly in travel, healthcare, property, and security.
I focus on simplifying complex systems, combining technical depth with leadership experience - whether that's modernizing legacy code, building cloud solutions, or helping teams work better together.

This is my blog where I write mostly self-notes on software development topics.

Also, I am an ultra runner, with PRs: 148kms in 24 hours, 16 Backyard loops, 3:22 marathon, and 1:28 half.
