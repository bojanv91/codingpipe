## Bojan Veljanovski's RESUME

My name is Bojan Veljanovski. I am a software engineer, architect, and technical leader with 15+ years of experience building software and leading teams across various industries. My expertise spans the .NET ecosystem, modern JavaScript frameworks, DevOps practices, and cloud platforms like Azure and AWS, with deep experience in domain-driven design, distributed systems architecture, and agile development.

I started programming in 2003, creating quiz games and utility apps for fun in VB6. My professional journey began in 2010 as an independent developer, building .NET web-based systems for various clients. In 2013, I joined a software development company as their first software engineer, quickly progressing to tech lead and architect. By 2015, I had become CTO, leading a team of about 40 engineers until 2024. 

Throughout these roles, I've delivered maintainable technical solutions while building high-performing engineering teams - whether modernizing legacy systems, building solutions from scratch, or helping teams work better together. Currently, I'm focusing on R&D management consultancy, helping organizations improve their engineering practices and system architecture. 

In my free time when kids go to sleep, I write code on personal ideas, write on this blog, or train for ultra-running events.
