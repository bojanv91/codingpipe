## Bojan Veljanovski's RESUME

My name is Bojan Veljanovski. I'm a software engineer and architect with 15+ years of professional experience. Currently, I work as a software consultant and R&D manager for an IT consulting company. I'm focusing on leading engineering teams, architecting new products and solutions, modernizing legacy systems, and improving development processes.

Before, I was the CTO at a software development company for 8 years, growing and leading a 40-person engineering organization, delivering software solutions in various industries. Previously, I worked as their first software engineer and later architect/tech lead for 4+ years, building distributed systems using .NET, web, and cloud technologies. I've also been an independent developer, building .NET apps for multiple clients. I started my programming journey in 2003, creating personal apps in VB6 while learning to code.
