When working with unfamiliar or complex codebases, building a quick prototype in a separate project can save you time and reduce risks before making production changes. With modern AI tools, you can create prototypes much faster than before.

## Why Build a Prototype?

A prototype gives you a safe space to experiment without breaking existing code:

- **Better understanding** - Test your approach in isolation to fully grasp how it works
- **Lower risk** - Find technical limitations and issues early, before touching production code
- **Accurate planning** - Give better time estimates based on actual experience
- **Clearer communication** - Show stakeholders something concrete instead of just explaining ideas

## How to Create Effective Prototypes

Create a dedicated prototype project structure:

```plaintext
YourSolution/
└── Prototypes/
    ├── NewIntegration.Tests/
    ├── EmailApiTrial/
    ├── UIPlayground/
    ├── RefactoringProposal02/
    └── PerformanceBenchmarks/
```

Keep prototypes minimal, disposable, self-contained, and documented. Test only what you need to understand, don't worry about code quality, avoid production dependencies, and capture what you learned.

**After prototyping, bring the concepts to production code, not the prototype code itself.**

## Just Start Prototyping

You don't need special approval to create a prototype. A few hours of prototyping can prevent weeks of problems. When stakeholders want fast delivery, prototyping actually saves time.

The most effective developers make prototyping a regular practice. When faced with unfamiliar code, complex design decisions, or integration uncertainties, create a quick prototype first, then make production changes with confidence.

## Example: Testing a New SDK

Instead of immediately creating abstractions for an SDK you don't understand:

1. Create a prototype project
2. Use AI to generate scaffolding: "Generate a C# test project that explores the key features of [SDK], including authentication, main API calls, and error handling"
3. Try different SDK features directly
4. Test error cases and limits
5. Understand how the SDK actually works
6. Then design your production integration based on what you learned

This lets you experiment freely before committing to a design in your production codebase.

## Summary

Hours or days of prototyping can prevent weeks of production issues. Create separate projects where you can safely explore unfamiliar code and accelerate learning without risk.
