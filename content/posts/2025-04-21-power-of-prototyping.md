When working with unfamiliar or complex codebase, building a quick prototype in a separate project can save you time and reduce risks before making any production code changes. With modern AI tools, you can create prototypes in hours instead of days.

## Why Build a Prototype?

A prototype gives you a safe space to try ideas without breaking existing code. Benefits include:

- **Better understanding.** Working with a solution in isolation helps you understand the problem fully
- **Lower risk.** Find technical limitations and issues early, before touching production code
- **More accurate planning.** Give better time estimates based on prototype results and new learning
- **Clearer communication.** Show stakeholders something concrete instead of just explaining ideas

## How to Create Effective Prototypes

Create a dedicated prototype project structure:

```plaintext
YourSolution/
└── Prototypes/
    ├── NewIntegration.Tests/
    ├── EmailApiTrial/
    ├── UIPlayground/
    ├── RefactoringProposal02/
    └── PerformanceBenchmarks/
```

Keep your prototypes:

- Minimal (test only what you need to understand)
- Disposable (don't worry about code quality or architecture)
- Self-contained (avoid dependencies on production code)
- Documented (capture what you learned)

After prototyping, bring the **concepts** you learned to production code, not the prototype code itself.

## No Need to Ask Permission

You don't need special approval to create a prototype, just like you don't need permission to write tests, refactor code, or document systems.

A 2-hour prototype can prevent 2 weeks of problems. When stakeholders want fast delivery, a quick prototype actually saves time, not wastes it.

## Make It a Regular Practice

The most effective developers have prototyping as a regular part of their toolkit.

When faced with unfamiliar code, large existing codebases, complex design decisions, integration uncertainties, or similar, create a quick prototype first, then make changes in production with confidence.

## Example: Testing a New SDK

One of the use cases for prototyping is when integrating a new SDK or library:

```csharp
// Don't do this first:
public class SdkWrapper
{
    private readonly NewSdk _sdk;
    // Creating abstractions for an SDK you don't understand yet
}
```

Instead:

1. Create a prototype project
2. Use AI to generate scaffolding (e.g. prompt: "Generate a C# test project that explores the key features of SDK, including authentication, main API calls, and error handling")
3. Try different SDK features directly
4. Test error cases and limits
5. Understand how the SDK works
6. _Then_ design your production integration based on what you learned

This lets you experiment freely before committing to a design in your production codebase.

## Summary

Prototypes help you safely explore unfamiliar code without risk to production systems. Create separate, disposable projects where you can experiment freely. Use AI tools to accelerate the process. Don't wait for permission—prototyping is a standard developer practice that prevents problems and improves designs. Whether exploring new SDKs or untangling complex systems, a few hours of prototyping can prevent weeks of production issues.

This approach accelerates learning and leads to more effective ways of working with unfamiliar code or complex systems.
